# IoT Based Visitor Monitoring System with E-mail Alert

## Overview
This project combines Cloud Computing and IoT to create a prototype smart security system. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, PIR motion sensor, and Wi-Fi connectivity, the system enhances home and office security by sending real-time email alerts with captured images upon detecting movement. This innovative model addresses the limitations of traditional CCTV systems by offering remote monitoring and immediate alerts, making it a cost-effective solution for modern security needs.

## Key Objectives
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use a Pi Camera and PIR motion sensor to detect and capture images of visitors in real-time.
- **Immediate Alerts**: Send email alerts with captured images to the user upon detecting movement.
- **Remote Access**: Enable remote monitoring through Wi-Fi connectivity, providing users with access to security updates from anywhere.
- **Cost-Effective Solution**: Provide an affordable and efficient alternative to traditional CCTV systems.

## Components Used
- **Raspberry Pi**: The core of the system, responsible for processing data and managing the other components.
- **Pi Camera**: Captures images when motion is detected.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Detects movement and triggers the camera.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Enables the system to send email alerts and allows remote monitoring.

## Results
The system effectively detects visitors, captures their images, and sends real-time email alerts, ensuring enhanced security for homes and offices. This IoT-based solution proves to be a reliable and cost-effective alternative to traditional security systems.
